# Photo Editor
Application that displays, and edits pictures form a given directory. This application was built in C# with Windows Forms.

Team responsibilities:
- Rede: Editor Form (see [branch](https://github.com/nestoralfaro/photo-editor/tree/ExperimentalBranch1)). 50%
- Nestor: Main Form (see [branch](https://github.com/nestoralfaro/photo-editor/tree/main-form-nestor)). 50%

Extra Credit implemented:
- Implemented splitter control to allow the tree view and list view to be resized.
- Added folder icons to all the folders in the tree view.
- Added "Save As..." button and functionality to the edit window, so that the user can give a new name to the file.
